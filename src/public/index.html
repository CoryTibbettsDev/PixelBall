		<p>
			Move you character with the arrow keys or WASD. Create a teleporter
			exit with E and an entrance with Q. If the ball passes through your
			entrance and you have an exit the ball with be teleported there.
			You can have one exit and up to two entrances. You can also create
			a barrier with R. If the ball hits it it will reverse direction
			horizontally. You spawn infront of your goal defend it while trying
			to score on your opponents, first to three wins.

		<h1>About</h1>
		<p>
			PixelBall is an online multiplayer browser game designed to be
			competitive and fun. It took inspiration from pong, air hockey and
			other such games but puts it's own twist of the game by making the
			player indirectly affect the ball by creating teleporters and
			barriers instead of just blocking it themselves.

		<h1>Patch Notes</h1>
		<h2 id="1.1.3">1.1.3</h2>
		<p>
			Players are now draw as images not colored blocks. Plan to make all
			game elements images so they can inherit the same draw function to
			simplify the draw logic.
			Added custom 404 and 500 error pages.
		</p>
		<h2 id="1.1.2">1.1.2</h2>
		<p>
			Player colors are now relative to each client meaning you will
			always be light blue no matter which side you are playing on.
			Plan on allowing the player to pick their colors eventually.
			Game animation now stops once the game is over will maybe add a
			pause feature at some point.
		</p>
		<h2 id="1.1.1">1.1.1</h2>
		<p>
			Game ending screen looks nicer and you can reenter the queue or go
			to the home page with one click. CSS is so great really.
		</p>
		<h2 id="1.1.0">1.1.0</h2>
			<p>
				Second release of PixelBall. Matchmaking bug appears to be fixed
				and the site actually looks ok with more information on how to
				play, an about section and patch notes. I bumped versions
				because it felt like there were enough big changes.
			</p>
		<h2 id="1.0.0">1.0.0</h2>
		<p>
			This is the first release for PixelBall. It looks terrible and there
			is a small matchmaking bug but it does work and is playable so
			I guess we take those.
